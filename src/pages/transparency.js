            <p>
              A pearl buried inside a tightly-shut shell is practically
              worthless. Government information is a pearl, meant to be shared
              with the public in order to maximize its inherent value. The
              Transparency Seal, depicted by a pearl shining out of an open
              shell, is a symbol of a policy shift towards openness in access to
              government information. On the one hand, it hopes to inspire
              Filipinos in the civil service to be more open to citizen
              engagement; on the other, to invite the Filipino citizenry to
              exercise their right to participate in governance.
            </p>
            <p>
              This initiative is envisioned as a step in the right direction
              towards solidifying the position of the Philippines as the Pearl
              of the Orient â€“ a shining example for democratic virtue in the
              region.
